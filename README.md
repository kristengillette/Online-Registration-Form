# Online-Registration-Form

Project created for <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse Tech Degree</a> program. 

In this project I built a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using supplied mockup files, I built a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and used a "mobile-first" approach.
